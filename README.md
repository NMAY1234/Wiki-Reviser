In this application, a Wikipedia search is conducted from a certain article
and then returns the last thirty editors of that particular Wikipedia Article.
This application uses MediaWiki's API to make a query requests in a JSON formatted
file to pull the information from the searched Wikipedia Article.
The UI is a basic layout of a search bar and prompt at the top center of the
application and returns two columns of information.
One with the editor's username and the other with the time stamp of the edits.

A user agent header is also used to allow the code to interact with Wikipedia,
making sure that everything is done with both the user and Wikipedia in minds.

This project was a collaboration between Noah May and Jamison Tucker.
